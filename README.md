# Vaeryn Virtual Computer

A hobby project to model a general-purpose computer architecture.

## Project Layout

Modelled on https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout.

## .vvb files

Vaeryn Virtual Bytecode files (`*.vvb`) are VCC program source code. A compiler
is included in which will compile `.vvb` files to binary files in a format which
can be executed on VVC.

See [./programs](./programs) for some examples of `.vvb` files.
